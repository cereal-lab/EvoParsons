    <h1>EvoParsons: Evolutionary Parsons Puzzle</h1>
    <p class = "text-justify">
      <strong>EvoParsons</strong> is a free to use, and open source, educational software.
      It is meant to help novice programmers improve their skills
      by practicing solving Parsons puzzles on their own.
      It allows instructors who are teaching an introductory programming course,
      to easily assign additional practice exercises to their students
      (with or without assigning participation credit) and have the software validate their work without the need for manual grading.
    </p>

    <p class = "text-justify">
      There are so far two versions of the software;
      one covering the Java programming language,
      and another covering the C programming language.
    </p>

  <h2 data-toggle = "collapse" data-target = "#parsons"> What are Parsons puzzles? </h2>
  <div id = "parsons" class = "collapse">  
    <p class="text-justify">
      As the name suggests, <strong>EvoParsons</strong> is based on
      <strong>Parsons puzzles</strong>.
      These puzzles have repeatedly shown great potential in supporting novice
      programmers’ practice.
      In a nutshell, a Parsons puzzle presents a description, in plain English,
      of the goals of a program.
      It then also presents students with an implementation of the solution to that problem.
      The solution is broken down into code fragments that the students are expected
      to reassemble in the correct order.
      In addition, some of the fragments have been duplicated and modified to feature
      syntactical or logical bugs.
      These so-called distractors are mixed in with their original counterparts thus
      forcing students to also learn
      to spot and avoid erroneous code by dragging these fragments in a trash area of
      the user interface.
    </p>
  </div>
  


  <h2 data-toggle = "collapse" data-target = "#evo"> What does EvoParsons add to Parsons puzzles? </h2>
  <div id = "evo" class = "collapse">  
    <p class="text-justify">
      <strong>EvoParsons</strong> goes beyond presenting students with hand-designed
      Parsons puzzles.
      Behind the scenes, the software leverages evolutionary computation techniques
      to automatically design Parsons Puzzles [2].
      These puzzles undergo improvement based on the difficulty of the challenge they present to students.
      Rather than simply attempting to evolve the hardest puzzles,
      this iterative improvement is guided by a push to find Parsons puzzles that are maximally informative about students’ performance.
      As a result, the evolved puzzles only retain bugs and problems that capture the difficulties
      encountered by different categories of learners.
      The end result is therefore a system that does not adapt to each individual student,
      as Intelligent Tutoring Systems usually do, but rather exploit learner-puzzles interactions
      to gain insights regarding the concepts with which students are struggling.
    </p>

  <h2 data-toggle = "collapse" data-target = "#aspects">What programming constructs do exercises cover?</h2>
  <div id = "aspects" class = "collapse">  
    <p class="text-justify">
      Regardless of whether you decide to use the Java or C version of the software,
      the exercises cover the following topics;
      <ul>
	<li>variables (declaration/initialization)</li>
	<li>selection statements (if / if else / if else if/ switch)</li>
	<li>loops (for / while /do while)</li>
	<li>arrays</li>
	<li>methods (Java) or functions (C)</li>
	<li>pointers (C only)</li>
	<li>structs (C only)</li>

  <h2 data-toggle = "collapse" data-target = "#students">What students may benefit from using this software?</h2>
  <div id = "students" class = "collapse">    
    <p class="text-justify">
      EvoParsons exercises combine a wide selection of constructs from the targetted programming languages (Java or C).
      As such, the software is primarily aimed at students who are reviewing in preparation for their final exam in an introductory course. 
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
      It is also suitable for students who are just starting a course which pre-requisites require them to already know Java or C,
      but need a refresher at the beginning of the semester.
      This is typically the case when undergrad students start courses such as; data structures, object oriented programming, operating systems...

  <h2 data-toggle = "collapse" data-target = "#test"> How do I test the software to see what it looks like? </h2>
  <div id = "test" class = "collapse">
    <p class="text-justify">
      We keep some sanboxes running so that instructors may get an idea of what the software looks like
      when their students will be using it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note that these sandboxes are wiped regularly.
      As such, do not point your students to those but instead see below on how to assign them practice with
      a proper URL.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
      When you are ready to check the software out, simply visit the following links.
      The software will run in any modern web browser;

      Contact us at <em>alessio -AT- usf.edu</em> so that we may
      set up an instructor account for you.
      Please provide a link to your official department's web site, and use
      your official university email address,
      in order for us to be able to ascertain that you are indeed an instructor.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
      Once you have an account, and we confirmed to you that it has been upgraded to an instructor account,
      simply share the same above link with your students.

    <p class="text-justify">
      If you need to track which students actually used the software,
      e.g., to assign participation credit,
      or need a measure of how many puzzles they successfully completed,
      e.g. to assign a grade, make sure that you 
      instruct them to use their university email address when registering
      and provide also their instructor's official email address
      (the one you used to register) as a way to link them to you.
      You will then be able to access our (rudimentary for now)
      instructor webpage and upload a list of your students
      email addresses in order to get information about their work.
      Once again, the link to use will depend on the programming language
      with which you assigned them to practice;

  <div id = "foss" class = "collapse">  
    <p class="text-justify">
      Starting with the "Mark III" release of the software, in Fall 2019,
      we implemented a new front end.
      This allows us to now have both the browser-side and server-side
      source code available under an open source license.
      Please refer to the following repositories for access; 
      <ul>
	<li> Source code for the "Mark III" release is hosted on GitHub at 
	  <a href="https://github.com/cereal-lab/EvoParsons/tree/Mark3" target="_blank">https://github.com/cereal-lab/EvoParsons/tree/Mark3</a>

	  <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/evotutoring/" target="_blank">https://sourceforge.net/projects/evotutoring/</a>.
	  These previous releases used the epplets.org user interface
	  as front end which is not available under an open source license.

  <h2 data-toggle = "collapse" data-target = "#releases">What are/were the features of each public release?</h2>
  <div id = "releases" class = "collapse">  
    <p class="text-justify">
    	Spring 2021 marked our third major publich release of the software.
	    It followed a period of internal testing at USF in programming courses
	    from various departments.
	    This allowed to apply bug fixes and minor further improvements
	    to both the user interface and the server-side.
	  </p>
	  
<p class="text-justify">
      Fall 2019 marked our second major public release of the software as
      "EvoParsons Mark III".
      Highlights of the changes are as follows; 
      <ul>
	<li>Integration of a MongoDB data base</li>
	<li>Redesign of the configuration files</li>
	<li>Total anonymization of the information collected.
	  Students &amp; instructors self-identify when login to the system but we only
	  get one-way-hash versions of any such information.
	</li>
	<li>Complete redesign of the user interface so as to base it on modern web
	  technologies and release it alongside the server-side components under
	  an open source license.
	</li>
	<li>Public release of support for the C programming language in addition
	  to previous support for Java</li>
	<li>...</li>
      </ul>
	  </p>

    <p class="text-justify">
      Spring 2019 was the first nation-wide release of our software, after a year-long
      use and testing at our own university.
      This release only focused on the Java programming language and was achieved in
      partnership with Dr. Amruth Kumar.
      As a result, EvoParsons used the same user interface than the Epplets Parsons puzzle
      Intelligent Tutoring System.
      It was also made available via Dr. Amruth Kumar's Epplet.org website.
      Our next releases will focus on integrating other languages (e.g. C, but feedback
      is welcomed!)
      and provide an alternative user interface that will be made available under
      an open source license
      (as is currently our server-side software).
