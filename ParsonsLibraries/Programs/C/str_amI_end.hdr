Finding  a string at the end of another string

[#description#]
This function returns 1 if the second string is found at the end of the first string or 0 otherwise. For example ami_at_end (s,t,len) where s = "something",
t = "thing" and len = 6 (the length of t) returns 1 because thing stays at the end of something.
